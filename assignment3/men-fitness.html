               Indeed. Diet plays more vital role in formation of a good body over just the exercise. As said, If you
                can control your hunger, eat healthy and avoid junk, a run alone could help you stay lean. Most people
                often ask what to eat, when to eat, if that is good for them, if it has too much calories, what does per serving size is,
                so here is an answer to all the unanswered in a short table. (Individual results may vary, this diet plan was made for a man
                with a height of 5'11 and weighing 78KGS.)
