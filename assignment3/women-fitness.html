                Indeed. Diet plays more vital role in formation of a good body over just the exercise. As said, If you
                can control your hunger, eat healthy and avoid junk, a run alone could help you stay lean. Most people
                often ask what to eat, when to eat, if that is good for them, if it has too much calories, what does per serving size is,
                so here is an answer to all the unanswered in a short table. (Individual results may vary, this diet plan was made for a woman
                with a height of 5'1 and weighing 50KGS.)

                If that has been your question for years, or if you are totally a begineer, here's a workout guide for you.
                <br>Start easy. Work in sets of 8 reps each. <br>This might seem intially too light exercise for some but always
                remember, the more you rush,<br> the higher chances you have of a muscle breakdown. Health is wealth. Make sure you
                play safe.
