<h3 id="h3"> HELLO THERE. WELCOME TO KANAV'S WEBSITE PROJECT !</h3>

<h3> WHY THIS WEBSITE ? </h3>

<p>
    This website assignment is my practice to make sure I am well known to HTML coding and CSS. The resume in this
    website can be used for future references. Tables and lists could be presented as my work in various fields. Other than
    that, I believe that the more we practice, the better we be. Malcolm Gladwell said that one needs 10,000 hours of practice
    to be an expert in anything. Maybe not 10,000 today, but every single hour I would be spending to make this project would help me get better faster.
</p>

<p>
    Other major objectives are as follows :
<ul>
    <li>Tell people about myself and show them my work </li>
    <li>Get connected with peers for their review an improve my work </li>
    <li>Get practical experience to watch out and mark someone's work</li>
    <li>Prepare myself for Mid term exam and the practical</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3> ABOUT MYSELF </h3>

<p> I am Kanav. I am 19 and I belong to the golden city of India, Amritsar.
    I am new at George Brown College and kind of an introvert person but I
    hope to easily get along with people here. I have done my high school back home,
    with some additional courses in C++, Java and Python. I also have interests in art and poetry. </p>
