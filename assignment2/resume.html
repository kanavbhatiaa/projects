<h3> SECONDARY EDUCATION (MARCH 2017) </h3>
<h3> BHAVANS SL PUBLIC SCHOOL, AMRITSAR, PUNJAB, INDIA </h3>

<p> I have been an excellent student in both academics and co-curricular activities. I did my
secondary education with 10CGPA, participated and achieved good rank in few Olympiads and
had been good at composition and storytelling. </p>

<p> Not just this much, I have enough confidence to
say that participating in house meets, debates and some general knowledge quizzes has made
me confident enough to convince people easily. Also, my keen interest in mental ability and
    problem solving has always helped me to find the best possible way-out. </p>

<hr>

<h3> SENIOR SECONDARY EDUCATION (MARCH 2019) </h3>
<h3> BHAVANS SL PUBLIC SCHOOL, AMRITSAR, PUNJAB, INDIA </h3>

<p> Passing with good grades and having supportive teachers, I chose to continue my studies in
science stream. I had Physics, Chemistry and Math as my major subjects. I was good at all of
them with no less than 80% in any of the subjects. I was also a regular student with an
attendance of more than 95% and no sick leaves. </p>

<p> When dedicated to something, I always try my
best to achieve the best possible. I was blessed to be my English teacher’s favorite for essay
writing, reading and fluent speaking of clear simple English. Other than my major subjects, I also
took music and traditional arts as my optional or additional subjects and scored 98 and 92 in
    them respectively. </p>

<h3> DIPLOMA IN FULL STACK 1 – COMPUTER PROGRAMMING (NOVEMBER 2019) </h3>
<h3> NIIT, AMRITSAR, PUNJAB, INDIA </h3>

<p> Being an excellent student in academics, I never wanted to sit idle as I finish my immigration
process to Canada. So right after my senior secondary education, I enrolled myself with one of
the renowned centers in India – NIIT. I did a complete 4-month diploma in computer
programming full stack – 1. Knowing the fast-growing world and the need of new tech, I believe
my course with programming will surely help me somewhere in future. </p>

<hr>

<h3> DIPLOMA IN PYHTON CODING (NOVEMBER 2019) </h3>
<h3> NIIT, AMRITSAR, PUNJAB, INDIA </h3>

<p> As mentioned above, I was enrolled in full stack programming program. However, it didn’t
include the python programming. The world runs on python. And I couldn’t let it go. I enrolled
myself in another course along with the previous one. It was difficult initially, but hard work will
pay off, right? Not bragging about myself, but I believe this Cleary shows that I’m
    dedicated and multitasking. </p>
